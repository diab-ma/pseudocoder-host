# privacy policy

**Last Updated:** January 10, 2025

## The Short Version

I don't collect your data. Not only do I not care at all about your data, but we also literally don't have any servers to send it to.

## The Slightly Longer Version

pseudocoder is a local-first tool. Everything happens on your devices:

- **Your code stays on your computer.**
- **Your terminal output goes directly from your computer to your phone over Tailscale or your local network.**
- **Your git commits go to *your* git remote, not ours.**
- **Your pairing tokens are stored locally in your device's secure storage.**

We don't have:
- Cloud servers
- Analytics dashboards
- Database clusters
- Marketing pixels
- Or any of that nonsense

## What We Do Have

- A Go binary that runs on *your* machine
- A mobile app that connects to *your* local network
- Zero desire to know what you're doing

## Third parties

The only "third party" involved is your own network. If you're using Tailscale for remote access, their privacy policy applies to that connection. But we're not integrated with them, you're just using their Vpn.

## Changes to This policy

If we ever add cloud features we'll update this. Until then, this policy is stable.

## Contact

Questions? File an issue on GitHub. We'll see it because GitHub sends *us* email, not because we're tracking you.

**TL;DR:** Your data never leaves your devices. We can't sell what we don't have.
