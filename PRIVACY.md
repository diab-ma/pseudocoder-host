# privacy policy

**Last Updated:** March 2026

## The Short Version

your code and terminal data stay on your devices. the mobile app collects basic analytics to help improve the product, but nothing about what you're actually working on.

## The Slightly Longer Version

pseudocoder is a local-first tool. Everything happens on your devices:

- **Your code stays on your computer.**
- **Your terminal output goes directly from your computer to your phone over Tailscale or your local network.**
- **Your git commits go to *your* git remote, not ours.**
- **File operations (browse, read, write, create, delete) operate within your local repository directory.**
- **Your pairing tokens are stored locally in your device's secure storage.**

the host binary has no telemetry and never phones home.

## Mobile App Analytics

the mobile app collects anonymous usage analytics like app opens, feature usage, and crash reports. this helps us understand what's working and what's broken. we don't collect your code, terminal output, file contents, or anything about your actual work.

## Third parties

The only "third party" involved is your own network. If you're using Tailscale for remote access, their privacy policy applies to that connection. But we're not integrated with them, you're just using their Vpn.

## Changes to This policy

If we ever add cloud features we'll update this. Until then, this policy is stable.

**TL;DR:** your code stays on your devices. the app has basic analytics, but we never see what you're working on.
